Chances are these days that you don't want this repo!  
If you are using modern Jupyter flavors like JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook 7+, you want [my animated_matplotlib-binder repo](https://github.com/fomightez/animated_matplotlib-binder).

This repo is to document approaches that work with the older-style Jupyter Notebook tech, namely Jupyter Notebook 6.4 and earlier, as well as what is now still avialable currently as  NbClassic. (If it's not clear why I am bringing up version numbers or what those terms are, see the second half of [my answer here that references resources detailing how the Jupyter ecosystem changed a lot in 2023 with Jupyter Notebook 7+ being built on the same components as JupyterLab](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76837597/8508004)). 
For a more visual guide, see ['Quickly Navigating the tech of the Jupyter ecosystem post-2023'](https://gist.github.com/fomightez/e873947b502f70388d82644b17196279).

This repository demonstrates animated plots with Matplotlib in notebooks served via the MyBinder system.  

Click on `launch binder` badge above to spin up a sesion where you can run animated plots.
